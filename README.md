# The Automation Fellowship: Packer, Terraform and Ansible

**Automation** is one of the most important aspects of the **DevOps** world. Today, without knowledge of automation tools, you can’t find a good job, as manual work consumes a lot of precious time. Imagine working in a chocolate factory and manually packaging each chocolate — it would be awful, and your factory would soon fail. As a DevOps engineer, you must know several automation tools. Through a series of stories called **“The Automation Fellowship: Packer, Terraform, and Ansible”**, I will explain three essential automation tools: **Packer, Terraform, and Ansible.**
Why did I choose these three tools? — Because they perform different tasks:
**Through Packer, we’ll create AMI images, Terraform will build our infrastructure using code, and Ansible will install what is needed on our infrastructure.**
